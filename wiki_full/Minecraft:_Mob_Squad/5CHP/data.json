Chug wonders as to what to do, and Mal realizes that they can use the minecart tracks to head back to Cornucopia before they do. Chug and company quickly run through the cave, with Mal deciding to have Lenna lead the way. Lenna, in turn, decides to have Poppy lead them to the minecarts. Eventually, after coming across some dead ends and several staircases, they find the minecarts. The illagers follow close behind, but Tok decides to hand a potion of slowness to Chug, who throws it at the illagers, greatly slowing them down.

He begins to cry, but everyone hugs him and acknowledges that they can go back after they save Cornucopia to bring the pig back. Lenna and company then go up a stairwell which leads to a trapdoor. Opening it reveals that they are inside a house in the Hub of Cornucopia, described as being in the style of the group\u2019s grandparents. Lenna finds some clay figurines on a mantel and looks at the writing, realizing that they are in Krog\u2019s house. Lenna and company then put a bed and a dresser on top of the trapdoor to prevent Krog and his illager friends from entering. Lenna and company then decide to enter the Hub, hiding their weapons from view, and notice that everyone is running around and loading carts. Mal heads directly to Stu\u2019s shop and explains to him that Krog has a group of illagers coming over to attack.

Chug also explains that the Founders were different (left a different place before settling in another) which was what made them special. Chug then says that there is one person in Cornucopia that would believe them, and Mal whispers that its none other than Nan.

Letti explains to Lenna that her parents were worried for the past week about where she was and that she needs to head home. Lenna refuses, and soon Letti notices Poppy, feeling frightened. Lenna then starts walking away. Letti exclaims that she\u2019ll be punished, but Lenna replies that she has something important to do whilst asking Letti to \"go home and snitch\". Lenna then shouts over her shoulder for Letti to gather the pickaxes from the family mine, and soon Lenna and company resume heading toward Nan\u2019s cottage. Nan greets everyone just as Mal informs her that illagers are coming. Nan wonders as to why, and Mal explains that Krog is planning to drive everyone out of Cornucopia while dressed like an illager, leading the illagers to the Hub, and plans to build a portal to the Nether.

As the group remove the bed and dresser from the trapdoor, Mal asks for Elder Stu to inform the town of the situation. He reluctantly does so, followed by Tok with several iron swords. The trapdoor then opens, revealing three vindicators, which are easily killed. Just then, more vindicators and vexes appear from below, leaving the group no choice but to head outside. Stu tries to inform everyone that they need to fight off the illagers, but two other Elders, Tiber and Zach, feel like its all hearsay.
