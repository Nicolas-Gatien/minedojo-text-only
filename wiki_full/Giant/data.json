This means that changes made to the zombie model (for example, using a resource pack) change the giant's as well.\nNotch mentioned Giant Zombies as a suggestion for a prefix mob along with other examples: \"Burning Spider\" and \"Cobble Creeper\" in a Bro-craft stream.\nNotch removed the giants spawning capabilities because \"they are too overpowered\". He did not remove them entirely because \"they are just too cool to remove\".\nIf a giant is riding a minecart, it hovers way above it.\nIf a mob is riding a giant, unless it's a large slime or magma cube, a ghast, or the ender dragon, it is hidden inside the giant's head.\nGiants have the same hurt sound as the player does.\nPlayers are unable to attack a giant's head and torso unless they are positioned near the bottom of the giant. Projectiles such as arrows can hit these areas as normal.\nGiants, being capable of dealing 26 \u00d7 13 to 75 \u00d7 37.5, and having 100 \u00d7 50 health, are capable of killing players without armor in one hit even in Easy difficulty.\nThis was found by looking through the Attributes data.\nThis also means they can OHKO piglin brutes in Normal difficulty.\nGiants may spawn naturally in some dimensions from the Java Edition 20w14\u221e snapshot, as well as Illusioners, this is due to the fact that the multiple dimensions from this snapshot have random mob spawn properties.\nKilling a Giant cannot give the player the Monster Hunter Achievement.", "bbox": [238.046875, 3756.453125, 690, 642]}, {"text": "Gallery", "bbox": [202.046875, 4416.953125, 726, 43]}, {"text": "A giant next to a normal size zombie.\nA giant \"riding\" a minecart.\nA giant in a cave.\nTwo giants summoned wearing equipment.\nA giant burning in a pool of lava.\nA giant getting damaged by a splash potion of harming.\nA giant in the middle of a plains biome.\nA giant spawner.\nIn 18w50a, a giant using the zombie AI.\nA giant that spawned with a chainmail helmet and an iron shovel spawned in 18w50a.\nA giant mob being seen from a player.", "bbox": [238.046875, 4468.953125, 690, 640]}, {"text": "A giant next to a normal size zombie.", "bbox": [240.046875, 4628.953125, 155, 36]}, {"text": "A giant \"riding\" a minecart.", "bbox": [398.046875, 4628.953125, 155, 18]}, {"text": "A giant in a cave.", "bbox": [556.046875, 4628.953125, 155, 18]}, {"text": "Two giants summoned wearing equipment.", "bbox": [714.046875, 4628.953125, 155, 36]}, {"text": "A giant burning in a pool of lava.", "bbox": [240.046875, 4822.953125, 155, 36]}, {"text": "A giant getting damaged by a splash potion of harming.", "bbox": [398.046875, 4822.953125, 155, 54]}, {"text": "A giant in the middle of a plains biome.", "bbox": [556.046875, 4822.953125, 155, 36]}, {"text": "A giant spawner.", "bbox": [714.046875, 4822.953125, 155, 18]}, {"text": "In 18w50a, a giant using the zombie AI.", "bbox": [240.046875, 5034.953125, 155, 36]}, {"text": "A giant that spawned with a chainmail helmet and an iron shovel spawned in 18w50a.", "bbox": [398.046875, 5034.953125, 155, 72]}, {"text": "A giant mob being seen from a player.", "bbox": [556.046875, 5034.953125, 155, 36]}, {"text": "Video", "bbox": [202.046875, 5126.953125, 726, 43]}, {"text": "Entities[show] [edit]", "bbox": [205.046875, 5420.953125, 720, 25]}, {"text": "Unused features[show] [edit]", "bbox": [205.046875, 5465.453125, 720, 25]}]}
