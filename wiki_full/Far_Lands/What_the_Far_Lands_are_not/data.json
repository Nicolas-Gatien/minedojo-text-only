While Far Lands chunks will still generate outside of what superflat chunks were generated in 1.1, these still are unrelated.\nModding the game can be done to either patch out this precision loss issue or the Far Lands individually.

Occurring considerably past the Far Lands' beginning, they are commonly said to be a \"part\" or \"layer\" of the Far Lands.

This is further reinforced by them being at a rather round number (32 million), rather than the seemingly overall arbitrary 12,550,824 of the Far Lands, or power-of-two values such as 16,777,216 where precision loss worsens.", "bbox": [202.046875, 1222.5, 726, 147]}, {"text": "It is likely that them occurring past the Far Lands is accidental. Their original positioning at 32,000,000 was likely done to make the Far Lands, then at 33,554,432, inaccessible without modifying the game. However, when terrain generation was redone, the Far Lands moved closer to their familiar position of 12,550,824, despite the boundary remaining at 32,000,000, meaning that the Far Lands were once more accessible, with the boundary no longer making them inaccessible as intended; it is likely that Notch would not have thought to check this at the time due to the distances being ludicrous. Fake chunks beginning in Alpha v1.2.0 (as opposed to the void seen in prior versions) are also likely unintentional, probably arising due to changes in chunk handling for biomes, the Nether, or both, and would have presumably also flown under the radar given their inaccessibility in normal gameplay without external editors.", "bbox": [202.046875, 1393.5, 726, 221]}, {"text": "Hard limits are not caused by the Far Lands", "bbox": [202.046875, 1638, 726, 24]}, {"text": "While the Far Lands themselves are technically a hard limit due to arising from integer overflow, they are treated solely as a terrain phenomenon, and the game still functions fine with them.
