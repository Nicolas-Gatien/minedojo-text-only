In most cases, this is exactly the same as the world seed, but can be different and the dimension generated is based upon this seed and not the world seed.[needs testing]\n settings: The noise settings used in the terrain generator. Can be set to a string to use a preset defined in the worldgen/noise_settings folder with a list of customized options. See Custom world generation#Noise settings for more information.\n biome_source: Settings dictating which biomes and biome shapes.\n type: The type of biome generation. Arguments lie in the biome_source compound. One of multi_noise, fixed, checkerboard, or the_end.\nIf type is multi_noise: 3D biome generation used in the nether, and in the overworld in snapshot 21w37a and after.[needs testing]\n preset: A preset of the set of biomes to be used, mutually exclusive with  biomes. One of nether or overworld.\n biomes: A list of biomes, including their target noise parameters.\n: A biome and its properties\n biome: The biome. A single biome ID may be repeated several times with different parameters.\n parameters: Represent optimal conditions for where the biome should be placed. These values do not affect the generation of terrain within biomes, they affect where the game chooses to place biomes. At any specific point, the biome having parameters most closely resembling the respective parameter on each noise map at that point is chosen. For example, if the point were to have values of -1 temperature, 0.2 humidity, 0.5 altitude and 0 weirdness then birch_forest_hills (-0.1t,0.2h,0.25a,0w) would be chosen over desert (0.5t,-0.5h,0a,0w). Parameter combinations should be unique in the biomes list, otherwise only the first biome entry will generate.\n temperature: Used to place similar biomes near each other. Not to be confused with the temperature value listed on Biome.\n humidity: Used to place similar biomes near each other.\n continentalness: Low continentalness corresponds to ocean terrain, high continentalness to inlands terrain.\n erosion: In the overworld, high erosion corresponds to flat terrain.\n weirdness: Used for biome rarity.[verify]\n depth: Used to generate cave biomes. This is the only parameter that can vary when moving vertically. A depth of 0 is at the surface, a depth of 1 is at 128 blocks below the surface.\n offset: Similar to the other parameters but offset is 0 everywhere, thus setting this parameter nearer to 0 gives the biome a greater edge over others, all else being equal. Increasing this makes the biome rarer, without altering the biome placement.\n min_quart_y: [needs testing]\n max_quart_y: [needs testing]\n firstOctave: The octave the first amplitude in the list is associated with. Lower values make the whole amplitudes sequence affect lower frequencies (smoother). Incrementing it by 1 doubles the frequency of the base octave.\n amplitudes: The amplitudes of consecutive octaves. Octaves further down the list have higher frequencies (double at each step). Higher octaves have intrinsically lower amplitudes in Perlin noise. This list further modifies the amplitudes by making low/high frequency features more or less pronounced. The resultant Perlin noise value at a certain coordinate is not just a simple sum of the independent components.[verify]\nAn amplitude. Setting one to 0 effectively disables that frequency component.[verify]\n large_biomes: Whether the biomes are large. True for biomes generation in the \"Large Biomes\" world type.\n legacy_biome_init_layer: Whether the world was default_1_1.[needs testing]\nIf type is the_end: Biome generation used in the end with biome minecraft:the_end in the center and other end biomes around.\nIf type is fixed: a single biome.\n biome: The single biome to generate.\nIf type is checkerboard: A biome generation in which biomes are square (or close to square) and repeat along the diagonals.\n biomes: A list of biomes that repeat along the diagonals (can be more than 3).\n scale: Determines the size of the squares on an exponential scale.
