This is the only parameter that can vary when moving vertically. A depth of 0 is at the surface, a depth of 1 is at 128 blocks below the surface.\n offset: Similar to the other parameters but offset is 0 everywhere, thus setting this parameter nearer to 0 gives the biome a greater edge over others, all else being equal.

Lower values make the whole amplitudes sequence affect lower frequencies (smoother).

Higher octaves have intrinsically lower amplitudes in Perlin noise. This list further modifies the amplitudes by making low/high frequency features more or less pronounced. The resultant Perlin noise value at a certain coordinate is not just a simple sum of the independent components.[verify]\nAn amplitude.
