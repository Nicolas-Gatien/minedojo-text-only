As Birch and Byte play around in some sunflowers nearby, Emmy plans to climb to the top of a nearby mountain dubbed \"Mount Farview\", with Birch concurring. The two then punch out some logs from a nearby tree to craft into planks, which in turn are used to craft a crafting table. After Emmy crafts some wooden tools, everyone starts heading toward Mount Farview. They notice a spider nearby, but it doesn\u2019t attack as the sun is still out. Not long after, Emmy, Birch, and Byte arrive at the base of the mountain, and decide to gather some more supplies. Emmy uses her axe to knock apples off a nearby oak tree, while Birch uses his wooden pickaxe to gather cobblestone. The pickaxe soon breaks, but Emmy then crafts Birch a stone pickaxe. As everyone begins to climb Mount Fairview, the sun begins to set, so they decide to build a shelter. Birch mines out cobblestone while Emmy uses it build a house. Just then, a skeleton fires arrows at them, but is killed with ease. More hostile mobs soon appear, like zombies and creepers, but all are killed by daybreak.

They first come across mobs such as cows and chickens, but Birch remarks that they belong to the villagers as they are in an enclosed space. Emmy agrees, and so the two continue exploring. Coming to a taiga biome, they find some rabbits and a fox. Emmy acknowledges that the rabbits are cute, but is worried about taking one from a family. Byte ends up scaring away the fox. Birch then spots a bees' nest and starts to knock it off of the tree with his pickaxe. Emmy warns him to stop, but by then, it was too late. A group of angry bees then chase everyone out of the woods and into a nearby cave, where they come across spiders, silverfish, bats, and numerous hostile mobs such as zombies and slimes.

As they leave the swamp, a creeper blows up right by them, making a crater in the ground. Emmy begins to worry that she might not be able to find an animal to be her pet, but a horse just happens to be nearby. Birch crafts a lead using string from a spider and the slimeball from the panda, while Emmy walks slowly over to the horse. Emmy then takes the lead from Birch while he feeds the horse an apple.

Feeling that Byte may have gone through it, Emmy and Birch decide to go through it as well, spawning in a warped forest in the Nether. Climbing a vine to get a better view of their surroundings, the two also notice a crimson forest, a huge swath of netherrack, and \"an ocean of lava\". Emmy then puts some warped fungus into her inventory as she and Birch head over to the crimson forest. Suddenly, the two are surrounded by piglins.

Emmy then attempts to use a carrot on a stick, but it doesn\u2019t work. As the mobs close in on them, Birch suggests to use the warped fungus to craft a warped fungus on a stick. Emmy does so, and just as she has the fungus in front of the strider\u2019s face, they begin to run across the lava. Emmy and Birch quickly head toward the nether portal, where they notice Byte on the other side, and soon go through it.
