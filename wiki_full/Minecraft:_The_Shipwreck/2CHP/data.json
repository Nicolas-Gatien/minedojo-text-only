Jake\u2019s father mentions to him that they (Jake\u2019s father and the construction company) plan on beginning construction next week, as well as overseeing renovation of the east and west towers. Jake feels excited at first, knowing that he\u2019ll finally have a place to stay, but the excitement quickly fades to fear as he realizes that he\u2019ll never be able to find out what is happening in the Minecraft server set up in the computer lab. Without hesitation, Jake quickly leaves the apartment for the computer lab.

Pattie asks if she could come over to Emily\u2019s place, but Emily mentions that she can\u2019t have friends over either. After the phone call, Emily goes outside with the Polaroid and takes some pictures of Pacific Crest. She eventually stumbles upon the community center, which is now fenced off for construction. Someone then scares Emily from behind, causing her to lose several pictures that she had taken. As she picks some of them up, she turns around, noticing Shark holding some of the pictures. Emily demands Shark to give the pictures back to her, but Shark refuses, and soon, he throws them over the fence into the construction area. As he walks away, Carmen calls to Emily that dinner is ready.

Jake had also noticed someone new: a security guard named Grant, who usually arrives around 10PM and leaves around 6AM. Jake arrives at the computer lab by 9:30PM, but soon notices a glow of light. He attempts to hide behind a construction tractor, but slips, causing his phone to clatter on the ground. A guy asks if Shark is here, and Jake is relieved somewhat that the guy is Tank.
