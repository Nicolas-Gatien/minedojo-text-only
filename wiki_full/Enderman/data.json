avoid could make the enderman significantly more scary. This gave Notch the idea to implement the staring feature, where aiming the crosshair at the enderman's face would cause a suspenseful moment in which breaking eye contact would trigger an attack, as well as the enderman having the ability to teleport so that when the player has stared at the enderman, they would have to face a consequence for that action.[11]", "Notch described that enderman would be peaceful, unless you looked straight at them, then they would rush in to attack whenever you broke the gaze.[12][13][14][15]", "In the Beta 1.8 demo at PAX, endermen dropped diamonds as a placeholder for ender pearls.", "The enderman has been officially introduced.", "Endermen are able to pick up any full block, including bedrock and spawners.", "Endermen have green eyes and emit black smoke, they also have zombie sounds as a placeholder.", "The enderman eye color has been changed from green to purple.", "Endermen now emit portal particles, rather than smoke.", "Endermen no longer pick up unobtainable blocks including bedrock, double slabs, and spawners and also no longer pick up blocks with inventories including chests, dispensers, and furnaces but can still pick up any other full block.", "Notch indicated the block carrying was horrible and needed to be nerfed.", "Before this update, endermen could be killed with the use of a bow.

This makes it extremely hard to get close enough to kill them during daytime.", "Before the Sound Update, endermen used the sound effects of zombies as a place holder. Then, in Beta 1.9, the zombie sounds for the enderman were removed.

Given the later development of the End, it is possible he already had the name in mind, and did not choose it because of the Reddit thread in which their name was revealed.[19]\nThe collective noun for a group of endermen is \"a haunting of endermen,\" as stated by Dinnerbone.[20] Additionally, in the third episode of Minecraft: Story Mode, The Last Place You Look, a player is given the option to correct the grammar of other characters by specifying that the collective noun for a group of endermen is \"a haunting of Endermen.\" In the fourth Minecraft novel Minecraft: The End, the collective term used by endermen themselves is \"an End of Endermen\".\nSwitching to spectator mode and taking an enderman's point of view adds a shader that inverts colors, suggesting that they see the End as an island of blue cobblestone (as end stone is a yellowish version of cobblestone with inverted colors) in a white sky, with white pillars, white endermen with green eyes and a white ender dragon, also with green eyes. They also see cobblestone as end stone.\nThe texture for an enderman's eyes is located in a different texture file than the body, allowing their eyes to glow. Because the two textures do not line up perfectly, forcing an enderman to look straight up causes its eyes to turn blank white.\nThe enderman teleportation sound also plays when a player teleports using an ender pearl\u200c[Bedrock Edition only] or chorus fruit.\nThe enderman is a playable DLC character in the crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros.
