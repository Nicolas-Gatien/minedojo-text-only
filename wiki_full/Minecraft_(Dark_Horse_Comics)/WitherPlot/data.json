Senan has his pet wolf, Wilkie, kill off the skeleton as the others rummage a nearby chest. Senan finds a totem of undying and says that it is valuable, but thinks there is more stuff abound inside the mansion. The three then search throughout the mansion, only to get in combat with numerous hostile mobs. One of the rooms is of a prison cell. After Orion opens the door, several zombies emerge, but they are killed with ease. Senan enters the cell, followed by Cahira and Orion. A door in the cell leads to a room that has soul sand in a T-shape, with wither skeleton skulls on the left and right ends. Orion finds a lever, but Cahira asks him not to pull it as she is jokingly worried about zombies. He pulls it anyway, unbeknownst to Senan, who shouts at Orion to not do so, realizing that it had already been too late.

Cahira then suggests for Atria to come along, saying that they could use her as bait for the wither, but she refuses, saying that she needs to deliver iron ingots to a village with assistance from her mother. Cahira and Orion leave feeling frustrated; the latter thinks that Atria will end up slowing them down. The two then have a light argument just as a spider shows up nearby. Cahira notices the spider and a plan hatches in her head. With Orion\u2019s help, they lure the spider to a hole created just above the doors in Atria\u2019s personal mine.
