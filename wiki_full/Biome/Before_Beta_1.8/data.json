Despite having a larger rainfall range than rainforest, the rainfall values fall into this range less often because they sometimes go outside of 0%-100% and are capped at those values, and can become \"stuck\" at 0% or 100% for some time.

But from the Adventure Update onwards, they are very rare outside the Extreme Hills, Modified badlands, shattered savanna, and modified jungle biomes, as mountain generation was entirely biome dependent. They were generated as part of the terrain generation algorithm from infdev to beta 1.8 prerelease. The idea of biome-independent terrain was re-inplemented in Java Edition 1.18.\nCliffs are often carved into hills, and sometimes have caves protruding into them. These caves contain the same blocks which one would find at the same layer in the hill they are carved out of. Sometimes cliffs intersected with hills in strange ways allowing for many chaotic landscapes to generate.\nSome of the most famous seeds at the time were notable for the chaotic and unpredictable nature of cliffs and hills.", "", "Ocean", "Oceans are large bodies of water with every single water tile being a spring.

They could be found in any biome. They came in two varieties: sand and gravel. Sandstone was located below sand in sand beaches, and occasional patches of clay could also be found.\nGravel beaches had no such underground border, and thus posed dangers such as falling into caverns located right underneath them. The famous \"404 challenge\" was possible due to this feature.\nThe block that beaches and ocean floors consist of is determined by the same algorithm. It is determined whether each X-Z coordinate generates with sand, dirt or gravel, and then if the highest terrain block is at altitude 65 (2 blocks above sea level) or below, the surface is replaced with that material.\nLike in deserts, exposed or partially buried dungeons could sometimes generate near the surface of beaches. The well known seed \"worstseedever\" had one in relative close proximity. However, due to changes made to the way dungeons generate in Java Edition 1.7.2, this is no longer the case in modern versions.\nDue to the changes in the terrain generation algorithm in the Java Edition Beta 1.8 update, beaches were removed completely from the game. They later returned with Minecraft Java Edition 1.1 as a separate biome, but lacked the spaciousness of old beaches from Beta versions, and only came in the sand variety.

Once the game gets the temperature and humidity values by pulling grass and foliage colors, it uses said values to grab colors from /misc/grasscolor.png or /misc/foliagecolor.png, and applies it to the uncolored grass or leaves. The same implementation also existed for water colorization with /misc/watercolor.png.
