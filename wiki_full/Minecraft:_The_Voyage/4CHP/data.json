Entering it, they notice glass windows and a door, and then, four of the raiders, ready to attack. Stax, Hejira, Ramoa, and Osk kill them with ease and enter the fortress from the cavern. They fend off several raiders until they arrive at a cavern with a ceiling of sand. Going through it, more than a dozen raiders suddenly emerge from hiding in the mounds of sand, and the four have no choice but to fend them off as best they can. Stax is surprised to see Miggs leading the raiders. Hejira moves to one end of the group of raiders, splitting them off. Osk, who is too scared to fight, runs out of the cavern. Stax and Ramoa attempt to move ahead, but notice Hejira chopping the sand with his sword. They yell at him to stop, but by then, it was too late.
