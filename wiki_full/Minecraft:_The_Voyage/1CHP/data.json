Above the pens are crops such as wheat, beetroot, and carrots. Inside the house lives Stax Stonecutter, the third in line of the Stonecutter family. Stax\u2019s grandmother built the house first, followed by Stax\u2019s father, who expanded it. Sadly, both have since passed, and are buried in a so-called \"place of honor\" beside a garden. Stax lives with his three cats: Coal, Emerald, and Lapis. Neighbors of the Stonecutters remember Stax\u2019s grandma as never being afraid to head down a dark cavern, only to return with precious minerals. The younger neighbors remember Stax\u2019s father as being an adventurer, who always traveled the world. The kind neighbors felt sorry for Stax, who became an orphan when he was just a teenager, but soon the unkind neighbors, who feel that Stax is lucky for having his family members work so hard, began to outgrow the kind ones.

Heading down to the storeroom, Stax pulls out a diamond axe from a chest and heads back up to chop down the oak tree.
