Redstone staircases can transmit signals both upward and downward but can take up much space and requires repeaters every 15 blocks.\nRedstone ladders: Because glowstone, upside-down slabs, glass and upside-down stairs can support redstone dust but don't cut redstone dust, signals can be transmitted vertically (upward only) by alternating these blocks in a 2\u00d71 \"ladder\". Redstone ladders take up less space than redstone staircases but also require repeaters every 15 blocks. In Bedrock Edition, glass and pistons can be used to create two-way vertical ladders that transmit signals both upward and downward (glowstone, hoppers, and slabs still allow the dust to power upward but not downward).\nTorch towers and torch ladders: A redstone torch can power a block above it, or redstone dust beneath it, allowing vertical transmission both upward or downward (different designs are required for each). Because it takes each torch a little time to change state, a torch tower can introduce some delay into a circuit, but no repeaters are necessary. However, every torch inverts the redstone signal (i.e. changes it from powered to unpowered), so having an even number of torches is required.\nObserver towers: An observer can power a block of a redstone circuit above or below it, allowing vertical transmission both upward and downward. Placing blocks that can be activated, such as redstone dust, noteblocks, or doors, both above and below it creates a state change when the observer is looking downward or downward when the observer is looking upward. Repeating this pattern means that updates are chained.\nDaylight detector exploiting: You can use daylight detectors to send a Redstone signal downward in 1 tick, but the path needs to be unobstructed by anything. You need to have a piston push a block over the sensor. It detects the change in light and emit a Redstone pulse. This design is extendable upward as far as you want, but you need to have the original hole open to sunlight. It also works only during the day, because it uses shadows to activate.\nBubble columns: An observer can be used to detect the block update that occurs when a water source changes to a bubble column (or vice versa). When swapping the block below a column of water sources to soul sand or a magma block from some other block, the entire column immediately changes to bubble column blocks. This can be used to quickly transmit a redstone signal upward to an observer facing the top water source/bubble column block.\nWall updating: A setup that can carry a pulse signal downwards across any distance involves walls of any type of stone, a piston, and an observer. When a wall block has a solid block on two opposing sides and non-solid blocks (e.g. air) on the other two sides, it takes a flat shape. This is vertically repeatable to up any height. However, when a wall/solid block is placed into one of the two air blocks around a flat wall, the flat wall block and every flat wall block below it are updated to a different version of the wall with a column in the middle. This update is instant and can be detected by an observer watching any flat wall in the tower. The update can be made repeatable by having a regular piston face the flat wall at the top of the tower, since the piston head also triggers the wall update.", "bbox": [202.046875, 3621.015625, 726, 1133]}, {"text": "Repeater", "bbox": [202.046875, 4772.015625, 726, 24]}, {"text": "To \"repeat\" a signal means to boost it back up to full strength.
