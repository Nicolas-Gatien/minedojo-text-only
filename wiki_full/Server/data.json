Usually, servers give the players Creative, but limit the items they can access and/or limit the plot size. This is usually done to prevent griefing to other players' plots and to prevent excessive lagspikes.\nMinigame: These are servers that host multiple minigames, ranging from Spleef to Capture the Flag.\nAnarchy: These servers have no rules at all. Many players engage in cheating, exploiting, and use of vulgar language.\nFaction: Similar in concept to Survival servers, but claims are used to mark land as \"yours\". Untrusted players will not be able to build on \"your\" land.\nPersonal/Private: These are servers that players can make on their own. Usually, the link is private, shared only with the user's close friends.\nHardcore: The same as survival mode, except players only have one life. This typically ends with a \"last man standing\" scenario, This type of server is mainly used in SkyWars and Survival Games.\nRoleplay: These servers have their players acting as their own persona, sometimes being dictated by the Roleplay that is happening.\nPay-to-Win: These servers have become slightly uncommon, as it violates Minecraft's EULA, but Pay-to-Win (P2W) servers (occasionally known as Pump-and-Dump servers, which are similar in concept to P2W servers) are designed around allowing users to purchase advantages (likely in the form of Ranks) for real-world money.", "bbox": [238.046875, 1711.328125, 690, 490]}, {"text": "Hosting a server", "bbox": [202.046875, 2267.828125, 726, 43]}, {"text": "There are many tools provided for players to be able to manage and host a server.

These are generally used for larger servers that run plugins to ensure griefer protection, non-vanilla commands (e.g./sethome), custom minigames, etc.\nRented servers are servers hosted externally by another company.
