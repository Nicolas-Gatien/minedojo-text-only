Huge, pig-like animals called hoglins roam around the nylium-covered terrain, whilst tribes of piglins hunt them for food. This makes it one of the only biomes to have an ecosystem. While not as numerous as in the nether wastes, the occasional zombified piglin also roams, and if near normal piglins, it will scare them away.\nIt is also one of the more habitable biomes in the Nether, due to hoglins being a source of food in the dimension, and despite being a hostile mob, it can be bred, making it perfect for farms in the dimension.", "", "This forest-type biome has the most amount of flora in the Nether dimension (due to the additional nether sprouts that are only found within the biome) but also only has two mobs, those being the endermen and the occasional strider. The amount of endermen here makes the biome an ideal place to collect ender pearls before the player has access to the End dimension.\nThe very low diversity of mobs here makes it another habitable place in the Nether, since no mobs spawned here are naturally hostile to the player.", "", "This desert-like biome is dangerous, not just because of the huge caverns and darkness that can allow numbers of ghasts and skeletons to spawn, but also due to the deposits of soul sand which slow the player down. Boots enchanted with Soul Speed allow the player to avoid the slowing effect of soul sand. Bluish-colored soul fire is common here and are more dangerous than regular fires.\nBecause of the huge amount of fossils here, the soul sand valley might have once been a habitable paradise full of huge, bygone creatures. It is unknown why they went extinct, but most likely a drought (which explains why the biome is dry) or a volcanic eruption from the basalt deltas were the culprits. The only vegetation surviving today are crimson roots and mushrooms, whilst the only mobs left are skeletons, ghasts and endermen, as well as striders that spawn over the lava ocean.", "", "With high amounts of lava and magma cubes, this is one of the most dangerous biomes in the game. The terrain consists of steep and spiky basalt formations along with the flatter deltas. When the biome collides with a lava sea, archipelagos of basalt and gravel form. The biome is almost impossible to build in, which might explain why bastion remnants don\u2019t generate here (unless a bastion remnant generates in a bordering biome).\nEven though the magma cubes here are dangerous, their spawning rate makes the biome ideal for collecting magma cream, which can be used for brewing Fire Resistance potions.

It has an explosion power of 5. The explosion is larger than that of TNT, which has an explosion power of 4. They cannot be used as a respawn point.\nOne has to use a powered respawn anchor to respawn in the Nether, but when it runs out of charges, the player once again respawns in the Overworld.\nThere is no way to place liquid water in the Nether without the use of commands, except inside a cauldron. These can be used to put out a player on fire, but are difficult to center oneself in.\nUsing water buckets produces steam particles and a hissing sound, leaving the player with an empty bucket.\nIce that is melted or smashed in the Nether does not produce water.\nA wet sponge instantly becomes a regular sponge when placed.\nIf somehow placed using cheats or when placed inside a cauldron, water takes on a reddish-brown color.\u200c[Bedrock Edition only]\nLava flows twice as far (eight blocks) and six times as fast in the Nether compared to Overworld, basically water's equivalent flow characteristics from the Overworld.\nGrass blocks and leaves take a dead-looking brownish color because the Nether is dry and hot.\nMaps generate a brown-gray static pattern. The player's direction indicator spins randomly; its location is still relative to the player's location in the Nether, except in the New Nintendo 3DS Edition, where it is always in the center of the map. Usable significantly for lava ocean travel via strider. Putting the map in the off-hand minimizes the map to help see one's strider footing.\nClocks spin wildly, making it impossible to tell the time while in the Nether. Compasses also spin wildly unless connected to a lodestone, which they then point toward.\nSnow golems rapidly take fire damage and die, due to the Nether being dry and hot. However, they can survive if they have the Fire Resistance status effect.\u200c[Java Edition only]", "bbox": [238.046875, 2447.40625, 690, 612]}, {"text": "Environment", "bbox": [202.046875, 3077.40625, 726, 43]}, {"text": "The Nether features unique cave-like terrain with no sky.

This contributes to a misconception that the Nether is \"below\" the Overworld, although Dinnerbone confirmed that they are simply separate dimensions.[6]\nIn Bedrock Edition, if a section of the bedrock ceiling is removed (e.g., through commands) mobs can spawn directly below where the ceiling should be, despite the surface density cap in the Nether being 0.\nIn Legacy Console Edition, the size of the Nether is limited, with bedrock walls surrounding it on all sides.
