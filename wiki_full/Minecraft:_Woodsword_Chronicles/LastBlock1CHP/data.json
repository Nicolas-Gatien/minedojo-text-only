As Ms. Minerva starts taking attendance, Doc bursts into the classroom and tells everyone to look outside the window. The entire class notices a rainbow. Doc then asks as to how rainbows appear, and Jodi jokingly mentions that its because of leprechauns. Doc then sprints back to her homeroom as Ms. Minerva mentions to her about the frog incident from earlier in the year.

As the group decide to head back to their castle (despite the compass being useless), Morgan mentions that one day, Dante had built his own skyscraper and let Morgan see it for himself. Morgan then noticed that one of the gargoyles on the skyscraper had a gravel block instead of cobblestone like the others, but he wasn\u2019t able to break it. It was then that Dante mentioned to him that he changed the settings of the game so that only he was able to remove and place blocks. Morgan begins to theorize that the foundation stone gives the Evoker King ownership of the Minecraft server that they are on, so to speak. In this case, the group is only allowed to place blocks, not remove them. Eventually, the group arrive at the torn down castle, but it had begun to rain.

Morgan considers building a barrier around themselves, but Harper objects, knowing that they can\u2019t break blocks.
