Jodi insisted on adding something else, however, that being a figure with hay for body, wooden fences for limbs, and a carved pumpkin on its head, dubbing it \"Scarecrow Joe\". As Harper begins brewing some potions, Ash points out that they are close to being at the area where the source of the Evoker King's power would be found, that being the X-coordinate and Z-coordinate of 0, the origin point.

Po mentions to him that he generally takes deep breaths to calm down, or if that fails, he imagines that everyone is dressed as a chicken. Before long, it was Morgan\u2019s turn to audition. He decides to go for an acting role, and the audition goes very well. Then, it was Po\u2019s turn. Although he prefers an acting role, both Ash and Ms. Minerva suggest that he work as part of the backstage crew instead due to him being a part of the basketball team. Po hesitates at first, but then dons a fake smile and decides to go ahead with it.

Originally, the school wanted to do \"The Phantom of the Opera\", but because they couldn\u2019t get permission, Ms. Minerva decided to go with an original play called \"The Phantasm of the Cafetorium\", noting that it was a mixture of \"Phantom of the Opera\" and Ms. Minerva\u2019s love of French pastries. Everyone is busy with their task; Harper works on the props, Jodi works on painting the scene\u2019s backdrops, Po works on the stage lighting while also assisting Morgan with his lines, and of course, Morgan studies his lines for the play.

Ms. Minerva had banned high-tech equipment from the school play due to what happened with the security cameras earlier in the year. Not just that, but Doc was also forbidden to alter any equipment for the play. Ash wants to include her in the play somehow, but is distracted when Morgan stumbles on a line.
