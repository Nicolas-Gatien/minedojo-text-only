Just then, Morgan hears a creeper nearby and orders everyone to get back just as the creeper explodes, killing the remaining zombies. Although everyone feels triumphant, Po warns of more hostile mobs descending the mountain, so they all decide to take shelter in the village.

Ash then notices an enchanting table in the back corner. Everyone realizes that they could use it to make powerful weapons and armor, but of course, they don\u2019t have the necessary materials yet. Morgan soon notices a white-clad villager watching the group from across the library, but with bright-orange hair and a long nose. The villager tosses Morgan some food to eat.

Ms. Minerva overhears this and says that she was informed by the school board that the bats would be exterminated over the weekend. Although everyone else protests this decision (with Ms. Minerva feeling sympathetic and wishing there was another solution), Ms. Minerva says that they can\u2019t continue to live in the gym. Back in Minecraft, Ash insists on everyone grabbing their beds and using them near the village. Jodi ask as to why they should head back, and Harper says that she plans on using the enchantment table there; she also plans on making armor and weapons if more iron can be found.

Morgan then places the pumpkin on top, spawning an iron golem. The group and the iron golem then line up in a row at the foot of the mountain as the sun begins to set. Just then, a horde of zombies crest the mountaintop, scouring down toward the village. The iron golem makes its move first, attacking some zombies by swinging its arms.

An old man speaks to them, saying that he comes to the park every night to watch the bats fly off into the night to find dinner, and feels angry about the condominiums that are being built there.
