Po thanks The Librarian for helping them, and she mentions that although the Evoker King had blocked her from accessing the game, she had assistance from a hacker who was able to find a weakness in the firewall. Morgan then takes a wild guess and says that The Librarian is actually Ms. Minerva, to which she smiles, shocking the group. Ms. Minerva mentions to the group that she had been playing video games since 1995, but she had never seen anything as powerful as the Evoker King. She asks the group if they really want to confront him, saying that they could just place down the VR goggles and walk away for good.

He says that the situation started when the Evoker King had hacked into the school system, which was due to the foundation stone that was in their Minecraft server.

It was because of the group that started playing the game, however, that the AI evolved into the Evoker King, changing its tactic from fixing the foundation stone to using it instead.
