It is always one of the following: empty, structure_starts, structure_references, biomes, noise, surface, carvers, liquid_carvers, features, light, spawn, heightmaps or full. All status except full are used for chunks called proto-chunks, in other words, for chunks with incomplete generation.\n LastUpdate: Tick when the chunk was last saved.\n sections: List of compound tags, each tag is a section (also known as sub-chunk). All sections in the world's height are present in this list, even those who are empty (filled with air).\nAn individual section.\n Y: The Y position of this section.\n block_states\n palette: Set of different block states used in this particular section.\nA block\n Name: Block resource location\n Properties: List of block state properties, with [name] being the name of the block state property\n Name: The block state name and its value.\n data: A packed array of 4096 indices pointing to the palette, stored in an array of 64-bit integers. If only one block state is present in the palette, this field is not required and the block fills the whole section. All indices are the same length: the minimum amount of bytes required to represent the largest index in the palette. These indices have a minimum size of 4 bits. Since 1.16, the indices are not packed across multiple elements of the array, meaning that if there is no more space in a given 64-bit integer for the next index, it starts instead at the first (lowest) bit of the next 64-bit element.\n biomes\n palette: Set of different biomes used in this particular section.\n Name: Biome resource location\n data: A packed array of 64 indices pointing to the palette, stored in an array of 64-bit integers. If only one biome is present in the palette, this field is not required and the biome fills the whole section. All indices are the same length: the minimum amount of bytes required to represent the largest index in the palette. These indices do not have a minimum size.\n BlockLight: 2048 bytes recording the amount of block-emitted light in each block. Makes load times faster compared to recomputing at load time. 4 bits per block.\n SkyLight: 2048 bytes recording the amount of sunlight or moonlight hitting each block. 4 bits per block.\n block_entities: Each TAG_Compound in this list defines a block entity in the chunk. See Block Entity Format below. If this list is empty, it becomes a list of End tags.\n CarvingMasks: Only for proto-chunks (not confirmed for 1.18 format).\n AIR: A series of bits indicating whether a cave has been dug at a specific position, stored in a byte array.\n LIQUID: A series of bits indicating whether an underwater cave has been dug at a specific position, stored in a byte array.\n Heightmaps: Several different heightmaps corresponding to 256 values compacted at 9 bits per value (lowest being 0, highest being 256, both values inclusive). The 9 bit values are stored in an array of 37 longs, each containing 7 values (long = 64 bits, 7 * 9 = 63; the last bit is unused). In versions prior to 1.16 the heightmaps were stored in 36 long values, where the bits were arranged in an uninterrupted \"stream\" across all values, resulting in all 2304 bits being used. The 9 bit values are unsigned, and indicate the amount of blocks above the bottom of the world. This means that converting a world to 1.18 adds 64 to every value.\n MOTION_BLOCKING: The highest block that blocks motion or contains a fluid.\n MOTION_BLOCKING_NO_LEAVES: The highest block that blocks motion or contains a fluid or is in the minecraft:leaves tag.\n OCEAN_FLOOR: The highest non-air block, solid block.\n OCEAN_FLOOR_WG: The highest block that is neither air nor contains a fluid, for proto-chunk (worldgen).\n WORLD_SURFACE: The highest non-air block.\n WORLD_SURFACE_WG: The highest non-air block, for proto-chunk (worldgen).\n Lights: A List of 16 lists that store positions of light sources per chunk section as shorts, only for proto-chunks (not confirmed for 1.18 format).\n Entities: A list of entities in the proto-chunks, used when generating. As of 1.17, this list is not present for fully generated chunks and entities are moved to a separated region files once the chunk is generated, see Entity format for more details (not confirmed for 1.18 format).\n: An entity.\n fluid_ticks: Each TAG_Compound in this list is an \"active\" liquid in this chunk waiting to be updated. See Tile Tick Format below.\n block_ticks: Each TAG_Compound in this list is an \"active\" block in this chunk waiting to be updated. These are used to save the state of redstone machines or falling sand, and other activity. See Tile Tick Format below.\n InhabitedTime: The cumulative number of ticks players have been in this chunk. Note that this value increases faster when more players are in the chunk. Used for regional difficulty: increases the chances of mobs spawning with equipment, the chances of that equipment having enchantments, the chances of spiders having potion effects, the chances of mobs having the ability to pick up dropped items, and the chances of zombies having the ability to spawn other zombies when attacked. Note that at values 3600000 and above, regional difficulty is effectively maxed for this chunk. At values 0 and below, the difficulty is capped to a minimum (thus, if this is set to a negative number, it behaves identically to being set to 0, apart from taking time to build back up to the positives). See Regional Difficulty for more specifics.\n PostProcessing: A List of 24 (number of sections in the height) TAG_Lists that store positions of blocks that need to receive an update when a proto-chunk turns into a full chunk, packed in TAG_Shorts. See ToBeTicked format below for a description of the coordinate packing format. A common use case for this to is make liquids flow after generating a source block, such as springs in caves.\n structures: Structure data in this chunk.\n References: Coordinates of chunks that contain Starts.\n Structure Name: Each 64-bit number of this array represents a chunk coordinate (i.e. block coordinate / 16), with its X packed into the low (least significant) 32 bits and Z packed into the high (most significant) 32 bits.\n starts: Structures that are yet to be generated, stored by general type.
