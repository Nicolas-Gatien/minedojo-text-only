It will fire out completely horizontal, or 0\u00b0. Gravity will quickly pull the shot to the ground, giving a very flat, downwards trajectory.\nWith small TNT charges, the range can be extremely limited. To increase the range, ever larger charges are needed or the cannon must be built higher above the ground. A larger charge means a higher velocity to the shot, pushing it farther away before it drops to the ground.\nPlayers have been known to use up to 70 TNT charges and beyond. But economically, a cannon without a mounting block will take more TNT and longer to load for a certain range.", "No Mounting Block", "Higher firing angle, can lob shots", "Low velocity, reduced power and poor range for smaller cannons, and it won't go as far.", "A single full size block such as cobblestone or obsidian is placed under the Shot. This has the effect of elevating the Shot above the water trough, so the blast force from the Charge is applied not just forward, but upwards. The shot is fired out at a high angle and trajectory. This is useful for hitting an elevated target, or one behind terrain or obstruction.\nHowever, part of the blast force is absorbed by a solid mounting block, so the cannon will suffer similar problems of needing large charge sizes. Also, since some of the energy is expelled in the upwards direction, forward shot velocity is reduced greatly.\nA better alternative to the single mounting block is using a ladder instead.", "Single solid mounting block", "Smooth trajectory (not too high, not too low), average velocity, more efficient for small and medium cannons", "Slightly reduced power, not best for either straight or lob shots, fuse range limit*", "A slab is the compromise between a single block and no mounting, and generally more efficient than either. More of a cannon's blast force is directed forward, but there is still an upward vector that raises the angle of fire to roughly 30\u00b0. As with a single block, some of the blast energy is absorbed by the block, but much less. From the same TNT load, the half block has greater range than a single block or no block.\nWhen the TNT shot is initially placed over a half block, it will hang over it as if it was a full size block. Once the TNT has been \"primed\", it will fall down and sit on the true height of the slab.\nThe firing angle produced by a half block is good for extending the range of a cannon and hitting elevated targets, but its too low for effective lobbing over high walls and obstacles. For straight direct firing, shots fired with a half block mounting generally land level on the ground within a certain range. However, due to the limited fuse time of TNT in the game, scaling up the TNT charges up to a point will result in the shot flying too high and exploding in the air before it lands or reach the cannon's maximum range. This will be refer to as the \"fuse range limit\". All cannons are limited by the fuse range limit, but cannons firing at higher angles are especially prone to the fuse limit, as the shot velocity is lower and shots reach higher altitudes.", "Stone slab used as a half block mounting", "Closed: Optimized for flat trajectory, velocity almost the same as no-block, have a very large range meaning it can destroy far targets.", "Be sure that priming circuit doesn't activate the trapdoor by accident. Very high speeds and oversized accurate shots could mean that if the primed TNT hits a nearby wall in the air, it will fall down and miss the shot. It cannot aim at medium or high elevated targets", "If the firing angle of the half block is too high for your purpose, a closed trapdoor can be used instead. Like the half block, it provides some upward force to the shot by elevating it above the trough. A trapdoor's height, however, is 3\u204416th of a full block. Firing angle is roughly 15-20\u00b0, making it extremely effective for straight shots at very long range (180+ blocks).\nLittle forward velocity is lost when firing, and shot typically fly out at very high speeds. This combine with the low firing angle means cannons firing larger loads can extend their range without encountering too much fuse range problems as with the half block or ladder mounting.", "Trapdoor used as a mounting block", "Open: Can be used in open position for higher firing angle, good scaling, can destroy higher targets", "Efficient with small and medium cannons, high firing angle, parabolic trajectory, good for lobbing shots and high altitude.", "Low horizontal speed, poor scaling, limited range at \u00b1120 blocks.", "A ladder placed on the side can serve as a very effective mounting block for firing at high angles and lobbing shots. A primed shot will be supported by the edge thickness of the ladder, preventing it from falling into the trough. Because a ladder is not a full size block, none of the energy from the blast is absorbed, and the shot is propelled out at full force. By adding ladders above each other, different firing angles can be achieved. Typically, a single ladder will give an angle just higher than a half block, roughly 40\u00b0-45\u00b0. Two ladders will give an extremely parabolic flight, shots fly out at about 50\u00b0-60\u00b0.\nA good portion of the blast energy is directed upwards on the block, so horizontal speeds are generally much slower than a no-mount or half block mount cannon. In return, the cannon has no problem lobbing shots over terrain and walls. At larger charge loads, shots can reach very high altitudes.\nHowever, this also means the fuse range limit is an inherent problem with this mounting. Within a 100 block distance, well built cannons level with the ground can expect to land shots low enough to cause damage. But beyond this shots explode midair way beforehand, even with a shot primed at maximum fuse time with a delay circuit. Hence, one can't simply add more TNT to increase the range, as it will only make the shot fly higher. A basic solution is to put the cannon below ground, in a pit with a slanted slope to allow the shot to fly out. Since the shot had a lower starting point, it will explode closer to the ground once its fuse time runs out. To reach ranges beyond 150 blocks, this solution becomes impractical.", "Ladder mounting block\nShot mounting with two ladders", "Efficient with small and medium cannons, low firing angle, good for shooting through caves and past overhanging base defenses. High velocity, extremely powerful in spread cannons and long range cannons.", "Expensive materials, fuse range limit to bigger cannons. If used a condenser, then the explosion will send the TNT too high and with no ceiling, the TNT can destroy the cannon.", "A fence placed at the end of the cannon tricks Minecraft to think that it is one block high, since it is only one and a half block high for the player's perspective. Therefore, the charge would be recognized as closer to the shot than it actually is. Since it gains more power and velocity, it appears to fly up a bit, then go down in an attack angle. However, the explosion launches the TNT upwards meaning if the cannon has no ceiling, the TNT can well destroy the cannon. This gives it a distinctive style of cannon shooting, and it is considered one of the most useful mounting blocks in Minecraft.\nif the cannon needs the water blocked a pressure plate may be used, but slightly decreases the launch velocity.", "", "Adjustable, when fully extended it has the same effects of a full block but is more efficient than it and is more versatile, compatible with firing sand or gravel.", "Expensive, the shot has been subject to the fuse range delay limit found in arcing cannons, is used as a mortar MB so usage inside caves or buildings is not recommended and will result in short range shots, accidentally placing two TNT blocks (one on top of the other) will destroy the cannon, requires a R4.7 delay.", "The three most common ways to use this mounting block are\nPrime the shot then push it up\nPush it up and then prime the shot\nJust use it as a more efficient version of the full block MB.", "A TNT cannon with piston mounting.", "Can lob shots.", "Fuse range limit, expensive, cannot aim at lower targets", "", "", "Second highest velocity.", "Can only shoot 9 blocks, expensive, make sure the circuit doesn't activate it by accident.", "This cannon is only used in an extreme hills biome.
