The range of a sword is up to 3 blocks, making it ideal for attacking other players in close proximity. A diamond sword enchanted with Sharpness V is capable of killing a player in unenchanted diamond armor in just 4 critical hits. However, the newly added netherite weapons deal exactly half a heart more of raw damage than their diamond counterparts. The sword deals more damage per second than the axe, and slightly higher knockback than other melee weapons, making it arguably the most effective. Swords also have the ability to perform a sweep attack\u200c[Java Edition only], knocking back and slightly damaging opponents near the initial hit.", "The axe deals slightly more damage per hit than the sword \u200c[Java Edition only]and can temporarily disable shields, but it has a slower attack speed and less durability. Despite these drawbacks, axes are effective weapons in PvP.\u200c[Java Edition only] Tip: If you're using an axe and the opponent is using a sword, try to jump before going in for a hit, then move backwards or sideways to try to avoid them from hitting you. A critical strike with an unenchanted stone axe or better deals 9 hearts of damage to an unarmored player, 4.5 hearts of damage to a player with unenchanted iron armor, and 2 hearts to a player with unenchanted diamond armor. This means it can kill a full iron player in just 3 hits, and a full diamond player in 5 hits. If you're fighting an enemy in iron, keep in mind that you don't have to critical the third strike unless if they're trying to eat up, as they would have only 1 heart left after the second hit.", "These are balanced and versatile weapons, which can be used for melee and distance combat. Once thrown, they do not slow down while underwater. They are best enchanted with Loyalty and Impaling. The other enchantments have their uses too, however. With Riptide, one can ascend to higher heights or charge forward when in water or rain. With Channeling, one can summon lightning to the trident's target during thunderstorms, exposing them and can also be used to make charged creepers, zombie pigmen, or witches.", "A fully charged bow not only deals more damage than a diamond sword, dealing 9 but it can also shoot up to 64 blocks upwards, making it a potent weapon from long range. Despite these advantages, a bow should not be used at close range as it has a 0.9-second charge time. However, if you are on pre-1.9 versions, shooting an approaching enemy with a low-charged shot to stop their movement before swapping to your weapon to engage in melee combat gives you a significant advantage in the fight, as you can now combo them easily, and even if you didn't, that low-charged shot means even if you trade hits, you still got a small advantage from the arrow chip damage. A well-enchanted bow is recommended for high-level PvP and should be used to pressure distant opponents, whether in quick volleys or powerful shots. By using tipped arrows, bows can also be used to inflict effects on players, such as Poison on enemies or Healing on allies. Tip: arrow trajectories are affected by your motion in versions Java 1.9 and higher, so keep that in mind when you jump to shoot somebody!", "The crossbow can be used like a bow shot with no charge time if pre-loaded. It deals 12 damage points, but keep in mind that it takes 3 seconds to reload, and in conditions when the other player(s) can see you, crossbows will put you at a disadvantage, because an ordinary bow has a shorter charging time than the reload rate of a crossbow. For these reasons, it is unwise to use a crossbow in a medium-long range bow fight. Reload it after taking cover or in circumstances where it is extremely unlikely for your opponent to hit you. Tip: In melee combat, the crossbow can be used as an instant projectile attack to chip your opponent's health after disabling their shield with your axe. This would make them take the arrow damage and knockback, giving you space to switch back to your sword/axe to attack again. In ranged combat, build a small wall with your blocks before trying to reload your crossbow. Enchanting a crossbow with Quick Charge III gives it the same charge time as a bow, greatly increasing its potency. It features its own enchantments and a slower recharge time then the bow and can shoot fireworks. The maximum damage inflicted by its projectiles is 11 \u00d7 5.5, and with the enchantment multishot it can shoot 3 at once. Using a multishot crossbow as a shotgun is the best way to go if you come across these. The player can use the crossbow at close range to deal massive damage by hitting all 3 arrows, and combining multishot with Arrows of Harming II, and you have a shot gun that can 1 hit any type of armor even after eating an Enchanted Golden Apple. The player can use it as a great weapon for sniping. If you shoot fireworks from crossbow with multishot, it will deal 18 splash damage. A crossbow with Multishot which shoot out Firework Rocket with big ball effect is the ideal weapon to take out a lot of enemies at the same time. However a crossbow with a Piercing is proven to be quite effective in combat as well, because the arrow goes through entities and bypasses shields, rendering the arch-nemesis of ranged weapons completely useless. Of particular note are Arrows of Harming II which when combined with Piercing, deals a hefty 12 \u00d7 6 damage that bypasses both Shields and Armor. It is proven that crossbows can serve to be a good choice against experienced opponents even without fireworks, once you are equipped with multiple either piercing and quick charge crossbows with harming arrows or firework multishot crossbows.", "Fishing rods are a gimmicky item, dealing no damage to players but knocking them back slightly on contact. Repeated strikes may open up a small window of opportunity for a combatant to slip in a few sword strikes. A fishing rod can be an effective tool for dealing durability damage to armor which may culminate in the armor breaking, or in knocking enemies off a platform and sending them plummeting to their death. Be aware of its durability, as hooking mobs or players results in 5 durability lost, one-thirteenth of the total unenchanted durability. Use it carefully or enchant it with Unbreaking and Mending. However, fishing rods are only the most effective in Minecraft Java 1.8, while bedrock is hard to tell. On 1.9+, a fishing rod can be used from higher ground to pull enemies upward, causing them to take significant fall damage.", "Armor allows players to absorb some of the damage dealt to them. Armor is vital for PvP and most players will die in seconds without it. Protection is usually the ideal enchantment for armor built for combat purposes. However, it is not as specialized as some other enchantments, such as Fire Protection and Blast Protection. These threats may prove more prominent than typical damage sources and are something to keep in mind when enchanting your armor.", "Shields can be used to block incoming attacks. Upon a successful block, shields negate damage and knockback from both melee attacks and ranged attacks. Arrows and tridents blocked by a shield may ricochet off onto nearby blocks or entities. If hit by an axe, the shield will temporarily be disabled for 5 seconds.\u200c[Java Edition only] Or shields will become useless from either it gets worn down or the opponent simply has a piercing crossbow.", "A combatant should make sure they have a full hunger bar during a fight. If hunger goes below 18 ( \u00d7 9), their health won't regenerate, and if hunger dips below 6 (), sprinting is impossible. It is recommended to eat cooked food, such as steak or porkchops, as they refill more hunger points than their raw counterparts. If possible, munch on the rare golden apple, as it grants temporary Regeneration and Absorption. In Java versions 1.9 and up, Foods preferred for saturation once an golden apple is consumed are usually suspicious stew or golden carrots, because they provide good saturation and allow you to not be affected by as much damage in battle as the rate of regeneration is much faster with a full hunger bar and saturation to spare.", "Milk eradicates all effects upon consumption. This is useful for removing any harmful effects, such as Poison, during your fight. Note that it removes all effects, including good ones.", "Blocks are useful in a pinch to obstruct the path of enemies or to create an escape path. They can be especially useful in tight spaces as you can block a pursuer, buying you valuable time to escape. Blocks can also be used to pillar up walls or other heights to reach safety. Watch out for projectiles that can knock you off! Tip: To prevent being knocked off by a bow shot or other types of projectile, block all four sides of the pillar with blocks, and have them be at least one block taller than the center which you'll build up on.", "Potions apply a variety of useful effects. These effects can strengthen allies and harm enemies when thrown as splash potions. In addition, lingering potions allow for a longer effect time, at of cost of it being a more expensive potion. Strength, Speed, Fire Resistance, Regeneration, and Instant Health are some of the best potions to have in your arsenal. Note that drinking a regular potion takes some time and may cause you to become vulnerable. That is why splash potions are used more often by some players. However, splash potions have the disadvantage of shorter effect durations, as well as the possibility of accidentally sharing the effect with nearby opponents. To get the maximum duration of a splash potion effect, throw the potion so that it lands directly on your head. Lingering potions are useful for either making an area inaccessible for a while or allowing everyone in a team to heal together. However lingering potions often cause huge lag and may benefit the enemy sometimes, so they aren't widely used.", "When thrown, it teleports the user to the location it lands. This proves quite useful for getting over walls or escaping dangerous situations. Note that ender pearls inflict damage to the player on use. You can hit someone with a pearl as they are escaping, allowing you to instantly catch up to them. Some players preferably will pearl to the side or behind the opponent's back. In some terrains like a steep cliff or the nether, one must throw it carefully or risk taking heavy fall damage. If you hit your opponent with it, they will take knockback as if you hit them with a snowball.", "Water slows movement, buying more time to escape. It can also be used to avoid taking fall damage, putting out fires, and traveling up walls.", "Lava is the ultimate barricade. You can use lava to greatly slow your enemies or heavily damage them (allowing it to be used in traps) if they don't have potions or enchantments.", "While the snowball inflicts zero damage, these weapons have a high rate of fire, allowing you to knock players off of cliffs. Most players will not expect an egg to be used as a weapon, and therefore it can be very effective and surprising. Snowballs also damage armor and are mass-producible using snow golems. Eggs may spawn chickens upon throwing, making it possible that your opponent may send a lethal hit meant for you onto a chicken instead. They are also projectile weapons which means they can be used in the same way as a close-range bow or a fishing rod, by hitting the enemy with a few of them when engaging to disorient their movement before going into melee combat to make them easy to combo and make it impossible for them to strafe effectively.", "Horses give riders a speed advantage, which is particularly useful in a chase, an escape, or in dodging ranged attacks through strafing. Horses can also be used to reach high places through their ability to jump multiple blocks in one leap. When you get hit while on a horse you won't be knocked back and falling damage will also be reduced. Beware when around water as a horse cannot swim in waters more than two blocks deep. Make sure to use horse armor and additional food to heal the horse, and maybe a lead to control the horse in certain obstructive terrains. It can also be used to jump on to obstruct the other player from hitting you, but may also result in the horses death while in combat, because the other player will target the horse first to create a delay when you pause for a brief second in the air when the horse dies to get some crits or a combo.", "In the right hands, redstone forms the foundation for effective traps and some weapons, such as TNT cannons. Building a trap in a strategic location and luring the opponent into it can be an easy way to win the fight. However, constructing traps or weaponry in the middle of a fight is highly impractical, and thus redstone constructs are best used with the element of surprise or at the start of a fight.", "If used properly, end crystals can be lethal to the opponent. By using the fact that nearby end crystals explode at the same time, you use these to kill a person in diamond armor. To use End Crystals effectively, the attacker must protect their lower hitbox, as the upper half of a player's hitbox does not take much damage from explosions. On hard difficulty, a single End Crystal explosion can instantly kill a full Protection IV diamond armor player if they are within four blocks of and have their feet on the same Y-level as the crystal. On normal difficulty, a point-blank end crystal explosion can take said diamond armor player down to half a heart. However, end crystals are hard to get as they require valuable items.", "If you are fighting in the Nether or the End beds are a cheaper substitute to end crystals, and they are easier to place as they don't have to be placed on obsidian. All you have to do is to right-click on a bed in the Nether or End to explode it, leaving behind a sizeable crater and tons of fire. A good tip is to try to stand on a block that is at least one block lower than where you are going to detonate the bed, or placing one block between you and the bed before exploding it, as this would protect your lower hitbox from the explosion damage, which is much more effective on the bottom half of your hitbox. If you really want to be safe, drink a fire resistance potion and have some of your armor enchanted with blast protection IV. However, beds could simply be used to suicide-bomb (or at least look like that to threaten) somebody who ambushed you, which is always better than losing your items to an enemy. With some more TNT and careful planning, one can create devastating explosions.", "Works similar to the bed, but a Nether variant of it. Although expensive, costing 6 crying obsidian and 3 glowstone blocks to make, and another glowstone block to power the explosion, it is still much quicker and easier to place and detonate than an end crystal, and more convenient than a bed, since it could stack up to 64. Can be pre-charged out of battle by fully charging with Glowstone then breaking one with a Silk Touch pick, letting an Anchor be immediately detonated without having to charge mid-battle.", "While usually impractical, TNT can be used to build traps or to distract and scare the opponent. With activator rails, TNT minecarts can also be used. Explosions also destroys items making it useful to render your opponents helpless if they are caught in an explosion. On some servers, notably the ones with minigames, TNT can be used as an explosive boost to launch players across a huge gap, allowing them to get to enemies on the other side and eliminating the danger of building across the void and getting knocked off. Tip: For this and the three items listed above, check the server difficulty, as that would determine the amount of damage these explosions will do, and remember that TNT jumps and that sort only work on easy difficulty. On higher difficulties, you'll just end up getting blown to smithereens, or take so much damage that it's not even worth doing.", "Flint and steel can be used to distract enemies and alter the battlefield by setting surfaces on fire. Once engulfed by flames, the player may be forced to consume a Fire Resistance potion, in which case they are left vulnerable for a period of time. Additionally, the flame effect incurred from being on fire obstructs a player's field of view, limiting their ability to perceive incoming threats.", "Fire charges can be fired from dispensers as a trap. They cause fire damage and obstruct a player's view.", "When held in the offhand, this will protect the player from a lethal hit (except from the void and the /kill command) and grant them regeneration and absorption which protects them for a while.", "These tools can allow the players to modify the terrain, allowing for tunnels and such.", "When tamed, they can aid the player in combat by attacking enemies. Bring meat to heal them and cause them to reproduce. However the enemy may spawn creepers that can scare dogs away or kill dogs immediately because dogs don't have a high hp.", "The elytra can be used to travel long distances at high speed, surprise attack enemies, and fly into their base. Wearing elytra reduces the user's defense due to taking up the chestplate slot. It is best to enchant your elytra with unbreaking and have a supply of phantom membranes to repair its durability. Often one will use elytra with a trident to save firework ammo.", "Fireworks can be used to boost an elytra's speed and damage enemies under a ceiling. They can also act as signals to teammates. They can be fired by hand or by shooting them from a crossbow.", "These can disarm tripwire traps without triggering them.", "Cobwebs can slow the enemy as a defense, whether for yourself or in your base, especially in combination with soul sand and ice. They can also prevent fall damage. By jumping into it, a player can score multiple critical hits easily, but at the cost of movement and mining speed. Bring ender pearls to escape quickly when needed. Cobwebs in water \u200c[Bedrock Edition only] make a great drowning trap."], "bboxes": [[288.203125, 2653.1875, 639, 202], [288.203125, 2855.78125, 639, 251], [288.203125, 3107.375, 639, 153], [288.203125, 3260.96875, 639, 300], [288.203125, 3561.5625, 639, 643], [288.203125, 4205.15625, 639, 227], [288.203125, 4432.25, 639, 129], [288.203125, 4561.34375, 639, 129], [288.203125, 4690.4375, 639, 202], [288.203125, 4893.03125, 639, 55], [288.203125, 4948.625, 639, 153], [288.203125, 5102.21875, 639, 276], [288.203125, 5378.3125, 639, 153], [288.203125, 5531.90625, 639, 55], [288.203125, 5587.5, 639, 55], [288.203125, 5643.09375, 639, 202], [288.203125, 5845.6875, 639, 227], [288.203125, 6072.78125, 639, 129], [288.203125, 6201.875, 639, 202], [288.203125, 6404.46875, 639, 276], [288.203125, 6680.5625, 639, 153], [288.203125, 6834.15625, 639, 227], [288.203125, 7061.25, 639, 104], [288.203125, 7165.84375, 639, 55], [288.203125, 7221.4375, 639, 55], [288.203125, 7277.03125, 639, 80], [288.203125, 7357.125, 639, 80], [288.203125, 7437.21875, 639, 104], [288.203125, 7541.8125, 639, 55], [288.203125, 7597.40625, 639, 31], [288.203125, 7628.5, 639, 129]]}}, {"bbox": [202.046875, 7856.09375, 725, 4474], "headers": {"text": ["Enchantment", "Description", "Used on", "Strategy", "Fire Aspect and Flame", "Sharpness and Power", "Thorns", "Knockback and Punch", "Protection", "Blast Protection", "Fire Protection", "Projectile Protection", "Feather Falling", "Respiration", "Depth Strider", "Infinity", "Unbreaking", "Loyalty", "Efficiency", "Mending", "Curse of Vanishing", "Soul speed", "Piercing", "Riptide"], "bboxes": [[202.546875, 7856.59375, 110, 31], [312.859375, 7856.59375, 126, 31], [439.140625, 7856.59375, 102, 31], [541.1875, 7856.59375, 386, 31], [202.546875, 7887.6875, 110, 545], [202.546875, 8433.28125, 110, 593], [202.546875, 9026.375, 110, 251], [202.546875, 9277.96875, 110, 276], [202.546875, 9554.0625, 110, 178], [202.546875, 9732.15625, 110, 276], [202.546875, 10008.25, 110, 276], [202.546875, 10284.34375, 110, 153], [202.546875, 10437.9375, 110, 251], [202.546875, 10689.53125, 110, 202], [202.546875, 10892.125, 110, 153], [202.546875, 11045.71875, 110, 178], [202.546875, 11223.8125, 110, 178], [202.546875, 11401.90625, 110, 129], [202.546875, 11531, 110, 104], [202.546875, 11635.59375, 110, 80], [202.546875, 11715.6875, 110, 80], [202.546875, 11795.78125, 110, 129], [202.546875, 11924.875, 110, 251], [202.546875, 12176.46875, 110, 153]]}, "cells": {"text": ["Deals fire damage, higher levels makes it last longer.", "Used on: Sword (Fire Aspect), Bow (Flame)", "Fire damage isn't affected by armor, but Fire Protection will lessen the damage.

It could also be used to counteract the knockback reduction of Netherite Armor, causing your enemy to take knockback again and making it harder for them to hit you.", "Absorbs a certain percentage of all damage depending on the level.", "For any armor.", "This is one of the best enchantments for armor as a full set of Protection IV can reduce damage additionally for another 64% on Java, and 80% on Bedrock. (see armor) A full set of Protection IV is the best choice for \"Protection-related\" enchantments on Bedrock, and will be the best in most situations on Java, sans the explosive-based endgame combat on hardmode servers.", "Absorbs a certain percentage of explosion damage depending on the level.", "For any armor.", "One piece of Blast Protection IV armor and 3 pieces of Protection IV will protect against the deadliest threats on higher difficulties, such as Creepers, TNT minecarts, or End crystals. It is most useful on hard difficulty where explosion damage is a serious threat and smart players may try to look for positions to blow you up instead of stabbing you to death. (Dear Notch, that was awful phrasing. Forgive me.) It also protects against fireworks, so if someone is spamming 7 layered fireworks at you with a Multishot Quick Charge III Crossbow, you'd be in a much better state with a piece of Blast Protection.", "Absorbs a certain percentage of fire damage depending on the level, and reduces the duration that you'll be on fire for after being ignited.", "For any armor.", "Having one armor piece with Fire Protection is a good idea in some situations such as in the Nether where items like flint and steel and lava buckets are common weapons. However, putting fire protection prevents you from putting other forms of protection on your armor, which may become a problem in the endgame, when you would have fire resistance potions rendering fire protection armor obselete, and you'd be taking extra damage since fire protection doesn't protect against much more dangerous threats like harming arrows, strength II axe crits, or end crystals.", "Absorbs a certain percentage of projectile damage depending on the level.", "For any armor.", "This should be the armor of choice for ranged combat. It can also be helpful against dispensers as they can fire arrows very quickly. Note that this only protects from the impact of the projectile, not any effects that come with it, e.g. fire from a fire charge or potion effects from a tipped arrow.", "Absorbs a certain percentage of fall damage, including damage from ender pearls and crash damage while gliding with the Elytra.", "Boots only.", "If you frequently use ender pearls to engage or escape or have the tendency to do oopsies with the elytra, this enchant will prove invaluable to you. It's always a good safety net to have, in fact, as you never know when you'll make a mistake and fall a large distance. It can also coexist with protection on boots, so you don't need to make the horrible decision of \"this or that?\" Note that even though the damage is negated and the enchant is called feather falling, the fall damage sound remains, potentially alerting your enemies to your presence.", "Wearer can breathe underwater for longer, and when suffocating there is more time between loss of health.", "Helmet only.", "This enchantment is rather useful for recon: you can spend more time hiding underwater in the enemy moat. This should be the enchantment of choice when fighting underwater.", "Wearer can move faster underwater", "Boots only.", "A rather underrated enchantment, but extremely effective in any fight involving water. This enchantment allows you to engage and escape much faster in a naval battle, and will give you an easy advantage if you combine its mobility bonus with placement of water buckets, as you'll wade through the water faster than your enemy.", "Fire unlimited regular arrows, but at least one must be in your inventory.", "For bow.", "Infinity is a good enchantment for spamming lots of arrows. This is well paired with Unbreaking, as the number of arrows that can be fired in total is increased. Keep in mind that it doesn't allow you to fire infinite tipped arrows, so if you're using tipped arrows to fight, it's much better to have a bow with mending which can be reused, or a Crossbow.", "Increases the durability of the tool.", "For all armor , weapons, and tools", "Although you need to go through more of a hassle to get Unbreaking on your items, it can be worth it in the long run. Getting Unbreaking increases the time before you have to reforge your sword with all its enchantments. Your armor would also last significantly longer in an extended fight. Try to get Unbreaking on your gear as soon as possible for maximum effectiveness.", "Allows your trident to come back to yourself after throwing", "For tridents", "Used to throw a trident multiple times as it will return to the player. Note that this enchantment isn't always reliable as if a trident is thrown into an unloaded chunk, it wouldn't come back, so don't expect to be able to abuse this enchant by spam-throwing your trident at the enemy.", "Increases mining speed of your tools.", "For tools", "Used if one wants to mine through the enemy base walls or dig escape tunnels. Also highly recommended for axe-wielders, in order to increase the chance of taking away a shield combatant's defensive behavior.", "Repairs items with experience", "Anything", "If the player is going through multiple battles, this will allow their gear to be repaired between matches with the experience dropped by killed opponents.", "When the player is killed, their drops disappear", "Anything", "If you get killed by another player, your items with this curse WON'T drop, so your enemy cannot use your items to attack you (or your team).", "Dramatically increases speed while traveling on soul sand/soul soil.", "Boots", "Useful in the nether for fleeing or charging. You can also carry soul sand/soul soil blocks with you to build a path to chase towards your foe.", "Allows arrows to have an added momentum that deals more damage if it pierces through one opponent. It also pierces shields, rendering them useless.", "Crossbow", "Extremely useful for fighting heavily armed foes with shields, allowing you to shoot tipped arrows through them, debuffing or damaging them regardless of if they block or not.", "Allows players to boost into the air when raining or in water, or just move faster in water.", "Trident", "Extremely useful when combined with elytra to grant flying capabilities, or as an escape in general. Be careful when using riptide without an elytra, however, as you might fall to your death if you go too high up and fail to break your fall."], "bboxes": [[312.859375, 7887.6875, 126, 545],

Be warned though, because you usually can't place or break blocks.\nAncient: Build a Colosseum inspired by the ancient Romans with fights against animals and perhaps some blood (redstone) on the floor (not historically accurate, however) \u2014 use stone or all the kinds of stone brick for walls, grass as the floor (sand also looks very nice) and wood for decoration and breaking the stone or stone brick up.\nSurvival Games: Huge arena that's in a dome and often has multiple biomes incorporated into it. The walls must be obsidian, bedrock or barrier. Supporters and spectators can send in messengers with food, armor etc. The battle goes on till only 2 are left who then need to go to the starting spawn point and fight to the death! Winner gets a good prize, losers don't.\nMaze: Build the walls and seats so the spectators can watch the combatants run around scared mind-less as they fear a creeper around the next corner.\nMulti-leveled: Have several floors on the arena with random holes; make sure the sides are made of glass so spectators can see all the gravitational action.\nNether Arena: It doesn't actually have to be in the nether. Make a 3 block high nether brick wall around the wanted arena area, and cap it with nether brick fences. Use a piston door with pressure plates on the entry side. Then, make a spectator booth that rises above the walls with nether brick stairs on one side. The arena floor should be netherrack with glowstone in the middle and even some lava dotted around (give players anti-lava protection to make things fairer). You can light some of the netherrack if you want, and add soul sand/soul soil for an extra twist. Have fun!\nSpleef Twist: Who says you have to do the dirty work? Let lava below the map do it for you (tell combatants before the match to avoid having to pay compensation)! Run around stabbing your opponent whilst removing the floor from beneath their feet.\nSky: Build the arena in the sky and use piston traps to make random holes appear. Gravity is now your best friend and worst enemy.\nGimmick: create your arena as uniquely as possible \u2014 make pistons push from the floor to give some players a height advantage (or disadvantage), use stairs to stimulate a slanted room to confuse anyone, or use water to slow everyone down and render sprinting useless. The possibilities are endless.\nRaining Lava: Once the start lever is pulled, opening the combatant entrances, a redstone repeater delay is all that's stopping lava from pouring from the ceiling. Using pistons and a two-minute delay, make lava pour from the ceiling and kill all remaining combatants! (or make it so they have to dodge lava 'raindrops'. (Remember: Don't use flammable materials!)\nDome: Create a giant sphere out of glass so spectators can spectate.\nSea battle: Put a pool of water in a glass bowl and give each player a boat, first to sink loses, or continue until someone dies.\nTNT Field: Put TNT in a random place and activate it. It will now cause a crater. Put multiple TNT to make crater bigger. Now put fences around it and let the battle begin!\nNatural Lava Arena: Find a naturally-generated lava. Get lots of golden apples and/or fire resistance potions. Hop in, you will be burnt during the battle. More excitement and difficulty!\nMob Attack: Fill the arena with hidden monster spawners. Watch as the players get attacked by both monsters and other players!\nSky Blocks: have a 40\u00d740 square up with a 50 block drop, have water at the bottom. Make multiple layers of having 1 block of air between the next block, so no blocks are actually touching each other. Make multiple layers with 2 blocks between, so players who fall down the first fall won't die, but continue. To add to the fun, do it while invisible in the dark, but make sure everyone is wearing a chestplate so it's still possible to play.\nTrap Arena: Make an arena that is mostly stone with glass peepholes for spectators. It can have traps involving pistons, lava, fire, arrows. Also, have a few traps without glass in case if a combatant develops the idea that glass signals a trap. Add extra glass for this reason. The combatants should be in Adventure Mode.\nSpace: This is a suggested battlefield. Add an effect to the battlefield, such as Jump Boost I or II and Slow Falling II. Then, battle through the \" lack of gravity\". To make it more challenging, add shulkers, so arrows can flow slowly.\nHoney House: An arena that's randomly placed using birch planks or stairs. Placed around and on the very top of it is an 8x8 birch plank battlefield when players will fall and slide through the honey block to get back up again.\nSurprise Areas: This is also optional. Use this area to add a surprise battlefield. In caves, add hidden areas to hide on using a piston and a button and hidden areas to bow the enemy. It is suggested to add levers that apply hidden TNT and to build random and hidden TNT cannons for an explosive surprise.\nSpellgrounds (Suggested Wizard Battles): This is a battlefield has full of effects like 5x5 levitation pod with slime, so people can battle through the air. A \"Poisonous field\" can be added for when they fall they will get the Poison effect and so that players will be sure to fall and speed ramps (Speed IV and Levitation II) so they can explore far through the battlefields. This also helps the players to escape.\nHighgrounds (Knockback Field and King of the Hills/Ladders Battles): Put some levitation pods, so that players can get to the high grounds. Players have to knock them off the cliff. Put water below the cliff. The player that is the last on the high grounds wins will be the King of the Hills.\nBridge: Everybody's challenge of if they can cross without being hit by eggs, snowballs, bows, snow golems, etc. Players can hit their opponents using eggs, snowballs, bows, snow golems, etc. until they fall through the void or the lava, To defend yourself from falling use shields, pearls and some blocks. Players can also practice fighting someone on 5x5 glass field to avoid falling.\nGrasslands This a field that test of accuracy and sharpened skills, this will test your awareness from enemies, like unknown bow attacks, getting spleefed by enemies, this can also help you become more aware around players in Murder Mystery also playing in grasslands mostly comes by spawning, but helps you charge, using this arena that you can use for advantage.\nBedrock Formations This area is just made out of bedrock formations, it makes PvP a lot more interesting and makes movements more challenging. It is usually used for Crystal PvP.\nIllusion: Using certain blocks makes a battle a battle confusing. Using glass, create different illusions like fake blocks that may leave to another area, random portals, and hidden traps. Players must know what kind of field are they battling in. that's why these creations will confuse a player, but if that player is smart, they can use the illusion battlefield to escape.", "bbox": [238.046875, 12894.0625, 690, 1911]}, {"text": "Use the environment to your advantage", "bbox": [202.046875, 14829.0625, 726, 22]}, {"text": "Here is an example of how you can use the environment to your advantage:", "bbox": [202.046875, 14863.5625, 726, 25]}, {"text": "The Nether: Use a Knockback sword, Punch bow, or even the knockback from charging your opponent to knock them off a higher platform.

Bonus points for knocking them onto magma blocks or finishing them off from above with a bow/crossbow/trident. Soul Speed will be especially useful in a Soul Sand Valley, and you can use that to your advantage.\nThe End/End City: Use a Knockback sword or Punch bow to try to knock your enemy off the island. If you are in an End City, lure a shulker into hitting your opponent, which will inflict Levitation, sending them into the air and disorienting them. You can then shoot them repeatedly with a ranged weapon. Once they fall, finish them off with a trident, sword or axe.\nDimension Explosives: In both the Nether and the End, Beds are a deadly explosive weapon if you can get the timing right. The deadliest strategy involves knocking the enemy up elevated terrain with your sword and/or axe before intentionally exploding a bed next to them on the elevated terrain while they're still in midair (make sure your feet are below the bed when you blow it, otherwise the recoil damage may end up killing you instead!) This will massively damage/kill the enemy, and you don't really receive much recoil damage. A downside to this strategy is that the fires after the explosion may burn some valuables the enemy/enemies are carrying. Respawn Anchors in the End or the Overworld are also an option, but are more expensive and takes slightly longer to activate. However, Respawn Anchors are stackable which make them more reliable for endgame combat.

Height: should be the solid type, used to stop elytras, cannons and climbers, best with a lava shield, at least at the bottom to kill elytra pilots. Don't put them too outwards.

Checker: put multiple layers of clay, wood, obsidian, liquid or cobwebs (choose two from those) in a checkerboard pattern. As they are mined with different tools, enemies must switch tools constantly (most of them won't bring shovels, shears, and axes at all!) in order to get pass them, and it's hard for them to climb if liquid is one of the materials. Cobble: use water and lava in a single layer accordingly to continuously generate cobblestone, these can't be mined through without enough intelligence,(a wrong step in disarming it may leak liquid out which drowns/burns players) and is usually explosion (wither) proof! Fill any other space in that layer with obsidian. Room: make an empty space without lighting to spawn monsters in it, all walls around it should have no liquids. One can put it around a spawner to maximize its potency, or lure some exotic monsters in and lock them (wither cages). When the enemies break the surrounding walls, an array of monsters (which spawns while they are near and mining through the other layers difficultly) will flood out!
