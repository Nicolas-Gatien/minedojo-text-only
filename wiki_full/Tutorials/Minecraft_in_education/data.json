For older children, reading the wiki and online guides can extend their skills.", "Writing", "Players can use the Book and Quill within the game to keep a log, or to communicate information to other players. By contributing to the Minecraft Wiki, older children learn to write informational texts in a collaborative, multimedia environment!.", "Math\n17\n\n+\n44", "The crafting system can help in teaching basic math (e.g. \"I need 3 sugar cane for paper), which transitions to multiplication (I need 3 Paper and 1 leather for a book, and 3 books for a bookshelf, so I need 9 paper and 3 leather altogether\") and division (\"When I create paper I get 3 at once, so 9/3 = 3 times per bookshelf I'll have to create paper\"). If players want to create a fully powered beacon, they will need to mathematically calculate amounts of materials (iron, diamond, emerald, gold) they need to create the pyramid, which is 9 times {\u2211i=1~i=4 (2i+1)2}. This means(9+25+49+81)\u00d79 = 1476 = 23\u00d764+4= 23 stacks and 4 pieces of materials. This shows not only you need math very much in Minecraft, but you also practice and possibly learn some mathematics skills.", "Geometry", "While the Minecraft world is only made up of cubes, the creations a child makes may resemble other shapes. Parental involvement can help teach children to recognize these shapes (cube, cuboid, square based pyramid.) Structures made with blocks to resemble shapes and figures can also help children with dimensions - x, length, y, height, z, width, and possibly also w, time. Also, counting the number of blocks that were dug out when making a 6x6x3 cave can help multiplication skills and understanding the concepts of volume and area. Also, Minecraft is all about three-dimensional graphing. A Minecraft world is based on x, y, and z coordinates, and uses both taxicab geometry (e.g. for lighting) and Euclidean geometry (for determining where monsters spawn and despawn). This very useful method of gaming can be used to learn high-leveled math such as the Pythagorean theorem (e.g.: x2+y2=c2) therefore not only is Minecraft used to learn \"child-level geometry\", it can also be used to learn fairly difficult geometric concepts very easily.", "Music", "With the preparation of some Redstone circuitry, experimenting with Note Blocks can teach children about notes, octaves and chords.", "Social skills", "By setting up a private server, parents can provide a safe environment for children to interact with friends and make playing Minecraft a cooperative event. Using a Local Area Network (LAN, or \"home network\") will allow children to play in the same room or same WI-FI network with their friends. By using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP, or \"voice chat\"), a phone call, or the in-game text chat, they can play together wherever they are. It is also possible to set up a Minecraft Realm. A minecraft realm is a server run by Mojang. Minecraft Realms costs $13/Month. You can easily setup a server and invite your child's minecraft friends. You can also set up various minigames for your child to play on or just a default minecraft world. For more info on Minecraft Realms, go to this page. These methods allows children to work together to build, explore, and learn as they develop their social skills, especially teamwork. For older children, contributing to the Minecraft Wiki can be a chance to learn about Internet etiquette and collaboration.", "Basic Technological Science", "Redstone circuitry provides an interactive environment to build basic logic circuits and combine them for more sophisticated purposes. Feedback is immediate, and the mistakes don't destroy expensive electrical components. Large, complex calculation devices can be created that can run algorithms. Advanced binary arithmetic and logic can be learned. Even basic and intermediate microprocessors that run programs can be made with user interfaces and screens that display complex results. The importance of concepts such as circuit compactness, speed, and simplicity are emphasized when circuits are relatively large and slow. Online communities can teach these concepts, and even real-world circuits, programs, algorithms, and concepts can often be transferred to circuits in Minecraft. Advanced arithmetic systems can be made using comparators and analog logic.", "Linguistics\nHello! - \u00a1Hola! - Hallo!\nSalut! - \u0393\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5! - \u4f60\u597d", "Via the options menu, children can select various languages to use while playing Minecraft.
