If you do, a popup will probably show you a message saying \"launcher_profiles.json could not be found.\" To get around this, first go to File Explorer. Then, type \"%appdata%\" in the address bar on the top. Near the top of the list, you will see a folder called \".minecraft\". Open it, and scroll down until you see a file called \"launcher_profiles_microsoft_store.json\", and then right click, select rename, and call it \"launcher_profiles.json\". Important! Don't forget the .json at the end or it won't work. Make sure to keep the window open and start setting up the download for your mod/mod loader. When it's finished, go back into the window where .minecraft is open and rename launcher_profiles.json back to launcher_profiles_microsoft_store.json. Now you should be able to play your mods without problem.", "bbox": [202.046875, 578.390625, 726, 196]}]}
