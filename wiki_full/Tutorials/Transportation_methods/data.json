However, the player must take note of the elytra's durability, which gradually decreases while flying (The Unbreaking enchantment can be added to slow this effect, and Mending can be added to exchange gathered XP for durability). Phantom membranes can be used to repair elytra in an anvil if necessary.

A soul sand bubble column can be used to move villagers upward. Alternatively, if the tunnel is flat, one may use an open fence gate or sign above an ice block adjacent to each last flowing water block to prevent the other adjacent water (source block) to flow backward, therefore creating a cheap \"railway\".\nBoat: A simple way to transport a single villager over ground is to push one into a boat and then drive the boat, which can be rowed (albeit slowly) over land. A boat can move upward by using a piston in the ground or creating an upward bubble column. The player can also drive the boat up to the step, place a second boat on the step, break the first boat (without hitting the villager) to cause the villager to move to the second boat. In Bedrock Edition, a boat can be pulled up using a lead.\nJob blocks/beds: To move a single unemployed villager, the player can place down a job site block and have the villager claim it. Continuously break and place the job site block, luring the villager to where you want it to go. At night, you can do this with beds, but it is dangerous because mobs, especially zombies, can spawn. Alternatively, to move a whole village at once, one can break all beds, job site blocks, and the village bell, and continually place them down like above.\nNether portal: If portals have not already been constructed in The Nether, then the player can create a portal at the Overworld destination, travel into the nether and back out again immediately, then build another portal in a village less than 128 blocks from the first portal. After pushing villagers into the village portal (manually or by minecart), then pushing them back out again, letting them \"cool down\" for 30 seconds, and pushing them back in, the villagers should exit from the first portal.[verify]", "bbox": [238.046875, 4316.203125, 690, 563]}]}
