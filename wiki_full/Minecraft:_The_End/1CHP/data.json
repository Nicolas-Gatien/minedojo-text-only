The two eat some chorus fruit for lunch and then teleport to the central island where they meet Hubunit Paa, an elder enderman. All endermen worship an entity known as the Great Chaos, with the universe being divided into Chaos and Order. People in the Overworld, known as Overworlders, believed in Order, while the endermen believed in Chaos. To please the Great Chaos, endermen travel to the Overworld to sabotage construction by the Forces of Order. Mo greets another elder enderman known as Hubunit Lopp. She is staring off the edge of the island, awaiting her fellow endermen to return from the Overworld. Endermen are further defined as follows: a group of endermen is called an End; Enderfrags are young endermen; Hubunits are mature endermen; Nubunits are \"fully grown endermen who had not yet replicated to start their own End\"; Cruxunits are ancient ancestors that had replicated and started their End from themselves; finally, an endermen working together with other endermen is called an endstacking. Lopp offers Mo to be a part of her endstacking, but Mo refuses and hurries back to Fin, where they teleport to the top of an obsidian pillar. Mo suggests about traveling to the Overworld, but Fin is skeptical, understanding that Mo might be killed there.

Kan especially hates Taskmaster Owari, who tells Kan to get stronger every time Kan complains about training. As Endermas is coming up, Fin beings thinking of what gifts he'll get for Mo and Kan when an enderfrag flashes next to him, making them get in contact with each other's thoughts. Mo's thoughts consist of a hold with treasure and mobs from the End inside of it; basically what her End would look like. Kan's thoughts, on the other hand, were \"musical notes dancing in beautiful spirals\", meaning that Kan loves music. The enderfrag, named Koneka, then asks Fin why he isn't in the Enderdome. Fin explains that he has no hubunits, and because of such, the Endmoot decided that it would be best for Fin and Mo to live away from everyone else.

Kan then begins playing his note block while explaining that his hubunits strongly dislike hearing the note block, which is why Kan ran away. Kan explains that without him being with his hubunits, they get weaker and dimmer as they use their energy to find him.
