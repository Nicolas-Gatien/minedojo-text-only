A flute joins in, as well as additional layers of percussion and a synth choir that sings a sliding melody and intensifies in sound as the song continues. Later, the track expands into a more intricately layered, electronic track, consisting of many layers of electronic textures that fluidly move about. It starts playing quieter static-like periods at the end. Strange, almost organic-sounding electronic chirping noises can be heard throughout the track, as well as quiet reversed chimes.

After it suddenly succumbs to excessive bitcrushing and glitching, it echoes out, and a low-pitched drone starts and grows slowly, eventually gaining a harmony of choir voices as the track becomes a very dark ambient piece with an ominous air of desolation and hopelessness.\nThroughout the track, extremely distorted and/or remixed versions of parts of the tracks \"Cat\", \"Haggstrom\", \"Dry Hands\", \"Wet Hands\", \"Subwoofer Lullaby\", \"Oxyg\u00e8ne\", \"Danny\", \"Clark\", \"Equinoxe\", and \"Beginning\" from Minecraft - Volume Alpha can be heard, as well as \"Floating Trees\" from Minecraft - Volume Beta, as ambient noises play in the background and build in intensity. The track slowly increases in volume as new layers of sounds fade in until it becomes much louder.\nAt the climax of this piece, a pulsing, one-note synth ostinato suddenly appears from the drone and is overlaid with a half-tempo rendition of the song \"Sweden\", which greatly increases in volume until the melody is overtaken by the choir and it abruptly stops with a motif from \"Subwoofer Lullaby\" and echoes out.\nAfter a period of relative silence, the drone and ambience reappears, accompanied by soft, echoing chimes layered with reversed chimes, and then a sudden static hum brings in some very slowed down samples from \"Minecraft\".\nThe drone slowly fades away as an ambient wind sound comes in waves, and this wind sound continues for some time.\nThen, the drone and ostinato quietly return for a very short time before another static hum interrupts the track and there is total silence, except for vinyl static.\nA stuttered loop of a small portion of \"Minecraft\" begins, once again underneath a layer of vinyl static.

It may be that this unexpected \"silence\" is an intentional way to emphasize this album's much darker tone.\nThe album cover is a dark, more surreal, and heavily stylized version of the same grass block from the album cover of Volume Alpha, which is likely meant to reflect the darker, more surreal style of Volume Beta in comparison to its predecessor.\nA very possible reason why \"Ballad of the Cats\" has that title is because the sounds of ghasts are distorted recordings of C418's cat.[7]\nThe music disc tracks are in stereo, as opposed to their in-game versions, which are in mono. It is likely that the in-game versions are in mono so as to make it seem as if the sound is coming from one single source (a jukebox) instead of from all around the listener.\nIt is equally possible that either the stereo versions or the mono versions of the music disc tracks were created first. The soundtrack versions are either the original tracks from before they were mixed down to mono for the game, or remasters of the original mono tracks that intended to provide a more \"complete\" listening experience outside of the game.
