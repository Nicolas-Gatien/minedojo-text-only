To make sure they are more prepared, they decide to learn more about the creeper, and hostile mobs in general. Sam collects more wood and builds a house before nightfall, and then mines iron the next day to craft some iron armor to protect themselves. Sam also suspects that creepers spawn in the dark, so they place torches around their house to prevent them from spawning. Despite this, Sam decides to venture out into the darkness, soon coming across a creeper nearby in a forest. They hide behind a tree as the creeper approaches, and then attacks the creeper, ultimately killing it and making it drop gunpowder. Sam decides to kill more creepers to obtain more gunpowder, ultimately using it with sand to craft TNT. The next day, Sam comes across a village and finds their first diamond in a chest. They also tame a cat, which helps to scare creepers away. A skeleton then appears and starts attacking Sam, but the creeper takes the blunt of the arrows and drops a music disc when killed. Sam picks up the music disc, kills off the skeleton, and then feeds fish to their cat before taking shelter in a house in the village that night. Some time later, Sam crafts a jukebox and begins dancing to the music from the music disc.", "bbox": [202.046875, 485.5, 726, 294]}]}
