It featured the entire area of Anarchia, complete with the exact locations of the three Haven Trials. The map was also split into three areas: Greenland, Desertland, and Mountainland. Greenland was home to a woodland mansion and had the first trial as killing an evoker. Desertland was home to the second trial, albeit no explanation was given. Mountainland appeared to be home to the third trial, but the player who made the map appeared to be unsure. Cece also realizes that teleporting to Mountainland isn\u2019t allowed, meaning that she would have to complete the first two trials in order to possibly do so. Just then, the bell rings to signal the end of break time, and Cece packs up the map as she heads back to class. Later, at the end of the school day, Cece is looking over the map in the school parking lot when Joachim bumps into her and looks at the map. Cece quickly stuffs it into her backpack, but decides to explain to Joachim about the situation that had been going on about her and Reesa and the server in general. Joachim then offers to look at the map again, and Cece reluctantly accepts. Joachim then mentions to Cece about the dark forest near the first trial, saying that she should build a shelter underground close by so she could be able to teleport between the shelter and the other trials. Cece thanks Joachim for the help, and Joachim mentions that he can be called Jo from then on. He then mentions as to how he used to play Minecraft with his group of friends, but stopped playing it when his friends moved on to other interests. Just then, Iya shows up and Cece and Jo soon part ways. Iya then asks Cece about her new friend and waves at Jo, much to Cece\u2019s embarrassment.", "bbox": [202.046875, 781.015625, 726, 416]}, {"text": "Chapter 10", "bbox": [202.046875, 1221.515625, 726, 23]}, {"text": "Switching to Cece\u2019s POV, she then launches Minecraft and soon heads back into Anarchia.

To make sure she doesn\u2019t lose her inventory when she dies, Cece deposits everything into the chests with the exception of the blocks of dirt and sand, not before filling up her hunger bar with some steak, an apple, and some sweet berries.

Nonetheless, Cece is ready, and soon teleports to just outside the woodland mansion. She starts climbing up a tree next to the mansion, and soon is on the roof of the mansion. Cece then looks down to peek at a window, soon noticing an evoker in the far corner of a room. She fires an arrow at it, hitting it in the back. Just then, four other players who were dressed in camouflage climb up to the roof of the mansion and focus on killing Cranky, Cece\u2019s pet cat that had seemingly teleported up there without her noticing.

Cece then jumps down into the room through the broken window to kill off a lone vex before heading back up to the roof. She fires an arrow at the evoker from her hiding place, being successful in hitting it. Just then, one of the other players fires an arrow at Cece, but Cranky suddenly flies across her to open its mouth and swallow the arrow whole. Everyone is shocked about what had just happened, and Cece soon realizes that Cranky protects her from other players. Nonetheless, Cece ends up killing the evoker, completing the first Haven Trial. The three other players, Arrow Boy, Axe Boy, and Sword Girl, are angry at Cece about killing the evoker, so they plan to kill her. Just then, WereDragon appears and kills Arrow Boy with a shot from a bow and arrow. Axe Boy and Sword Girl then scurry off as WereDragon has Cece pick up the totem of undying that the evoker had dropped, saying to her that the totem basically gives her another life. WereDragon then says that Cranky is named the \"Tailsman of Chance\", much to Cece\u2019s bewilderment.

At this point, Cece considers giving up altogether, but WereDragon gives her a pep talk about how long she had survived in Anarchia. WereDragon also mentions to Cece that her pet cat, Cranky, is actually a passive mob that had glitched out while the Ocury was installing mods, hence as to the reason why it was swallowing arrows that were aimed at Cece. WereDragon also says that the only way that Cranky can no longer protect its owner is if the owner is killed or separated from it for long enough for another person to gain its trust. Cece then asks WereDragon as to how long they had been here, and they mention that they had been here long enough to complete the first two Haven Trials, and even made it to the third trial. Cece wonders as to what is part of the third trial, but WereDragon says that they didn\u2019t know because of the numerous mobs that spawned there. Cece then wonders as to why WereDragon just didn\u2019t go back to the third trial, and WereDragon says that a player will need help to be able to get through it. Out of the blue, Cece asks WereDragon if they want to be her friend as long as they don\u2019t kill her again.

Cece asks Jo if he would like something to drink; he requests a glass of water. Baba then asks Jo as to why his parents didn\u2019t wait after dropping him off, and Jo mentions that he took a bus to get here, shocking everybody. Iya wonders as to what his parents would think, and Jo mentions that he hasn\u2019t seen his parents in a long time; instead he lives with his grandma who is unable to drive, which is why he takes public transportation. The conversation after that started to become awkward, so Iya allowed Cece and Jo to head outside to play until lunch was ready. Cece and Jo head to the garage to retrieve a bike, with the latter saying that he doesn\u2019t know how to ride one. Cece decides to show Jo how to ride one, but the other kids of Gemshore Estate begin mocking the two.

Ofure responds by attempting to slap Cece\u2019s hand, but Cece came prepared. She had already taken the caps off of the bottles of hibiscus juice, and when Ofure attempted to attack her, she pressed down on the bottles, releasing the juice all over Ofure\u2019s hair, face, and uniform.
