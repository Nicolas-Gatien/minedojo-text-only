The player can gain or lose altitude while flying by pressing the jump or sneak keys, respectively. Holding sprint allows the player to move faster while flying. In Creative mode, flying is automatically disabled if the player lowers onto a surface while in the air. \u200c[Java Edition only] In Spectator mode, flying cannot be disabled because players can fly through all blocks.

A player flying in fluids or cobwebs neither sinks nor slows down. The Speed effect does not increase flying speed.[1] In the spectator mode, scrolling up on the scroll wheel increases speed while scrolling down decreases it.
