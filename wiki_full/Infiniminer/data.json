Players can play on one of two teams, Red or Blue, as one of four classes: Miner, Prospector, Engineer, or Sapper. Each class has their own set of abilities, tools, and blocks they can build with, with each costing a certain amount of metal ore to place. Most building blocks are team-colored and serve a specific function rather than being purely decorative, and playermodels and tools are flat sprites instead of 3-dimensional objects. The sky is perpetually dark, and the landscape of the limited-size maps is made up entirely of bare dirt, stone, ores, and lava blocks which flow similarly to liquids in Minecraft classic. It was originally intended to be played as a team-based competitive game, where the goal is to locate and excavate precious materials such gold and diamonds, and bring your findings to the surface to earn points for your team, until the winning team reaches a certain amount of points. However, as the game gained popularity, players decided it was much more fun to build things than to compete for points.", "bbox": [202.046875, 1327.90625, 726, 319]}, {"text": "Discontinuation", "bbox": [202.046875, 1670.40625, 726, 43]}, {"text": "Zachtronics discontinued development of the game less than a month after its first release, after a major source leak was discovered which allowed hackers to make unauthorized modifications to the game.

In 2015, the Google cloud server for the game was shut down, but the game is still available for download, and the source code of Infiniminer is now available under the MIT License.
