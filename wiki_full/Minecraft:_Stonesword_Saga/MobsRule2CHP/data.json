They decide to collect some wood to make torches and then start heading back down the cavern. Theo then brings up that they should try to trap the giant cave spider like how they did with the Endermonster. The others seem to be in agreement. A pit is then created, albeit much deeper due to the fact that spiders can jump. The group then follow a tunnel which leads to a large cavern containing the giant cave spider. The spider is surrounded by several mobs with red eyes, like sheep, rabbits, and villagers, with the latter offering the spider bread and emeralds.

As the rabbits head out into the chamber, their eyes return to normal, making the group believe that not only does the spider\u2019s control over the mobs wear off at a certain distance, but Theo begins to believe that Po\u2019s army theory might not be holding up. Just then, the group hear the sound of the giant cave spider wailing, as if it was sad.

Theo says that he would like to have the computer lab back, with everyone else in agreement. Jodi says that she cares about recycling, and Shelly says although Woodsword is good about recycling practices, that it could be handled better. Shelly then brings up the block party, which is an annual after-school party that is held. Harper and Theo feel like the party is a waste, saying that money for that should be allocated to help improve the school instead, but Morgan says that he loves going to it. Jodi notices Shelly writing down the responses in her notebook, which gives herself the feeling that Po might not end up winning the election. Shelly then asks about the cookies, and although Morgan says that they are for Po\u2019s campaign, he offers her one anyway.

Po, understanding of the reporter\u2019s statement that many students feel like the block party is a waste of money, says that if he is elected class president, that the block party will be canceled.
