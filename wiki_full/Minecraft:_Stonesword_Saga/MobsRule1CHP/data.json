Harper thinks that getting a closer look at the Fault would help, as she likes to gather information on things before jumping to conclusions. Theo then says that the best place to find information on the Fault would be in the game code, reiterating that it was a suggestion. Po then tries to shrug off the Fault, saying that the version of Minecraft that they are playing had always been weird, knowing that they were playing using specially-designed VR headsets. The group then decide to hunt for butterflies, knowing that they had something to do with the transformation of the Evoker King. Theo then says that he saw one over by a mountain. Pointing to it, he also notices a small village at the base of it. The group decide to head over there, hoping to find out more information about the Fault.

Po then says that drama club is on a short break, and also says that he\u2019ll be able to set up schedules for the student government. This would mean that there would be no meetings on days that Po decides to play Minecraft with his friends.

Harper then asks Po as to why he would be a better candidate than Shelly for class president, such as what promises he would make. Po sheepishly admits that he doesn\u2019t know why, leading Theo to explain to Po that its basically a popularity contest if he doesn\u2019t have a plan or a reason as to why people should vote for him.
